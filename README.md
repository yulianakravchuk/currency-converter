Task Description:

Using the free version of https://fixer.io/ API implement a currency converter page (rendered by a new controller).

Everything should be implemented in a new cartridge using service framework and latest SFCC APIs and best practices.

The data should be cached locally in a custom object with expiration time of 5 minutes.

The code should be properly indented and commented (using JSDoc syntax). The code should have proper error handling and logging.

Currency converter should work with AJAX to update the currencies the user wants to view/convert.

Bonus points for using a framework like ReactJS/VueJS on the frontend to render the currency converter widget.
